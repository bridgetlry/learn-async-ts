- Extract the code in the setTimeout function and replace the setTimeout function  with the extracted code. Then run the main script. 
- Is there a difference in the flow of execution from when the code was in the setTimeout function?
- Is the flow of execution in both these examples different from the flow of execution with the examples using the fetch() API, which also returns a promise? 
- If yes, explain the code execution difference. Add your explanation to this file.


The flow of execution was different when replacing setTimeout with the extracted code. we call sum2Darray, 
which is asynchronous because it returns a promise, therefore we know it will not run sequentially with other lines of code.
We reject the promise if it is a length of zero, otherwise we go ahead to setTimeout which runs the code in it in a specific amount of time.
This function computes the sum of the 2D array.

At the end we return the promise: we resolve if we are able to complete a summation.
